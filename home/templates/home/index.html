I wanted to do something exciting and adventurous and I ultimately decided to go to Beijing to teach English. I didn’t know anything about what it’s like to live and work in China, and BeijingTeach really made the move over here as easy-going as possible. They took care of everything for me; set me up with a visa, a great job, and spacious apartment. I have traveled extensively throughout Asia and I now feel as if the world is my oyster, not to mention that I save a good chunk of change every month."</p>
